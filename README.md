We sell our kids old clothes at a seasonal sale held at a Curling ice
rink. My wife thought it might be useful to have a small database to
keep track of the items as we stage them for sale and afterwards
assess what sold and at what price. Mostly though, I needed a simple
domain to learn the Play! framework.

Dowload the following binaries and put them in the root of the application directory.

from Oracle:

    jdk-7u67-linux-x64.tar.gz
    jdk-8u20-linux-x64.tar.gz

from Typesafe:

    typesafe-activator-1.2.10.zip
