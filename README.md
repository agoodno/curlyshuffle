We sell our kids old clothes at a seasonal sale held at a Curling ice
rink. My wife thought it might be useful to have a small database to
keep track of the items as we stage them for sale and afterwards
assess what sold and at what price. Mostly though, I needed a simple
domain to learn the Play! framework.
